# calculatorusingjavascript


This code is a JavaScript program that creates a simple calculator web application. It defines variables to access buttons and input fields, and sets up event listeners for button clicks. When the equal button is clicked, it evaluates the user input using the eval() function, and displays the result in the input field. If the input is invalid, an alert message is displayed. The clear button clears the input field, and the erase button deletes the last character of the input.

The code also keeps track of whether the equal button has been pressed before, using the equal_pressed variable. If it has been pressed before, it clears the input field before adding new input, to avoid concatenating input to the previous result.

Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of a calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations. However, it has potential security risks as it uses eval() function which can execute arbitrary code, and it doesn't provide enough error handling for edge cases. Therefore, it's not recommended to use this code in a production environment without proper security measures and validation.
